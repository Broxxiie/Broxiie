      As the world celebrates love this Valentine’s Day, my heart overflows with gratitude for having you in my life. You are the melody in my song, the rhythm in my dance, and the light that brightens my darkest days. I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving.
<br> <br>
      Every moment with you is a cherished memory, each day an adventure, and every kiss a promise of forever. Your love is my anchor, keeping me grounded, yet your passion sets my soul free. You have taught me the true meaning of unconditional love, and for that, I am eternally grateful.
<br>
      “You have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you.”
<br>
<br>
      Your smile is my sunshine, your laughter my favorite melody. When I’m with you, time stands still, and all that exists is the magic we create together. You are my confidant, my rock, and my best friend. With you, I am home.
<br>
<br>
With all my love, today and always,
<br>
<br>
