      As the world celebrates love this Valentine’s Day, my heart overflows with gratitude for having you in my life. You are the melody in my song, the rhythm in my dance, and the light that brightens my darkest days.

      “I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving.” - Pablo Neruda
<br>
      Every moment with you is a cherished memory, each day an adventure, and every kiss a promise of forever. Your love is my anchor, keeping me grounded, yet your passion sets my soul free. You have taught me the true meaning of unconditional love, and for that, I am eternally grateful.
<br>
      “You have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you.” - Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice
<br>
<br>
      Your smile is my sunshine, your laughter my favorite melody. When I’m with you, time stands still, and all that exists is the magic we create together. You are my confidant, my rock, and my best friend. With you, I am home.
<br>
      “In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours. In all the world, there is no love for you like mine.” - Maya Angelou
<br>
<br>
      Our love story is my favorite, filled with moments of joy, tenderness, and even challenges that we have faced together. Each chapter we write is more beautiful than the last, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us.
<br>
      “I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more.” - Angelita Lim  
<br>
<br>
With all my love, today and always,
