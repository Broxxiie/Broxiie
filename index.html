    <h1>Happy Valentines Day Ever! ,</h1>
    <p>
      You are the melody in my song, the rhythm in my dance, and the light that brightens my darkest days. I liked you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love to admire you simply, without problems or pride: I want to express my admiration to you in this way because I do not know any other way.
<br> <br>
      Every moment we share becomes a treasured memory, every day with you feels like an exciting journey, and every time I look at you is a glimpse of hope.
<br> <br>
      "The world is brighter, the air is sweeter, and life is more beautiful because of you."
<br>
<br>
      Your smile is my sunshine, your laughter my favorite melody. When Iâ€™m with you, time stands still, and all that exists is the magic we create together. You are my confidant, my rock, and my best friend. With you, I am home.
<br>
<br>
I know we've talked about this and clear some things up, but I can't deny the fact that I still like you. Even if I stay low, keep my distance, and look at you from a far just makes this feeling even more intense. <br><br>
Just know that I'm always here for you, patiently waiting.
<br><br>
With all my love, today and always,
<br> <br>
