    <h1><center> Happy Valentines Day Ever!, </center></h1>
    
    <p>
      You are the music in my heart, the rhythm in my steps, and the light that lifts my darkest moments. I liked you without knowing why, when, or how. I cherish you effortlessly, with no questions, no pride â€” just pure admiration. I'm sharing my feelings this way because I don't know how else to express them. Every moment we share becomes a treasured memory, every day with you feels like an exciting journey, and every time I look at you is a glimpse of hope.
<br> <br>
      "The world is brighter, the air is sweeter, and life is more beautiful because of you."
<br>
<br>
      Your smile brightens my world, and your laughter is the sweetest tune. When I'm with you, time fades away, leaving only the magic we share. With you, I discover true serenity.
<br>
<br>
I know we've talked about this and clear some things up, but I can't deny the fact that I really still like you. Even if I stay low, keep my distance, and look at you from afar, it only makes this feeling even more intense. Eventhough life is tough, stressful and sometimes shitty, just know that you are loved. 
<br><br>
I have a lot to say to you but I'll keep this short. And as I always say: I'm always here for you, patiently waiting.
<br><br>
Again happy valentines day for you ^_^,
<br> <br>
